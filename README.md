The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. 
The purporse of this project is to evauate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
Use the following questions to explore the database, and find the answers, so you can provide them to the magazine editors.

Unless otherwise stated, for each question:

Use count_documents to display the number of documents contained in the result.

Display the first document in the results using pprint.

Convert the result to a Pandas DataFrame, print the number of rows in the DataFrame, and display the first 10 rows.

Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

Hint: The London Local Authority has a longer name than "London" so you will need to use $regex as part of your search.

What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

Hint: You will need to compare the geocode to find the nearest locations. Search within 0.01 degree on either side of the latitude and longitude.

How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
